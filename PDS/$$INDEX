These REXX functions were written as supplements for managing PPRC
volume pairs. They will be useful for HDS ShadowImage environments.

RXSIQRY  Returns the state of a PPRC pair
         status = RXSIQRY(devN)
         States are SIMPLEX, PENDING, DUPLEX, SUSPEND

RXV2DEV  Returns the device number of a specified volume
         devN   = RXV2DEV(VolSer)

RXSLEEP  Sleeps for a specified time
            y   = RXSLEEP(wait)
         Antoher sleep routine using STIMERM.
         Contrary to popular belief, it is impossible to
         escape from the wait by trapping the attention with
         a STAX. The attention exit gains control after the
         wait time has expired. This could be done by using
         multiple TCB's and some tricky logic. But this is
         just too complicated.

RXWTO    Issue a message to the operator
            y   = RXWTO('Your message')
