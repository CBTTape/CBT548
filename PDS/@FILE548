//***FILE 548 is from Alfred Nikolyn and contains some REXX         *   FILE 548
//*           functions, which are especially useful in disk        *   FILE 548
//*           shadowing environments, but which are useful in       *   FILE 548
//*           general.                                              *   FILE 548

//*      These REXX functions were written as supplements for       *   FILE 548
//*      managing PPRC volume pairs.  They will be useful for HDS   *   FILE 548
//*      ShadowImage environments.                                  *   FILE 548

//*      RXSIQRY  Returns the state of a PPRC pair                  *   FILE 548

//*               States are SIMPLEX, PENDING, DUPLEX, SUSPEND      *   FILE 548

//*      RXSLEEP  Sleeps for a specified time                       *   FILE 548

//*               Contrary to popular belief, it is impossible to   *   FILE 548
//*               escape from the wait by trapping the attention    *   FILE 548
//*               with a STAX. The attention exit gains control     *   FILE 548
//*               after the wait time has expired.  This could be   *   FILE 548
//*               done by using multiple TCB's and some tricky      *   FILE 548
//*               logic.  But this is just too complicated.         *   FILE 548
